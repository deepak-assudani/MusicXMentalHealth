# Music and Mental Health Analysis 🎵🧠

This project aims to explore the relationship between music and mental health, specifically focusing on depression. The analysis utilises publicly available data sourced from Kaggle, which is then cleaned and analysed using Python and Tableau.

## Data Source 📊

The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle and contains information on music preferences and mental health indicators. It includes variables such as music genre preferences, language of the music, and self-reported depression levels.

## Data Cleaning 🧹

The initial dataset required extensive cleaning to ensure accuracy and usability for analysis. This process involved:

- Removing null values to prevent skewing the analysis.
- Adjusting data types, including handling date and time data types, which presented challenges but were successfully resolved.
- Ensuring consistency and coherence across the dataset.

Python was the primary tool utilised for data cleaning due to its flexibility and extensive libraries for data manipulation.

## Analysis 📈

### Tools Used 🛠️
- Python for data cleaning and preparation.
- Tableau for data visualisation and analysis.

### Main Focus 🎯
The analysis primarily focuses on understanding the effects of different music genres and languages on mental health, particularly depression. Key areas of investigation include:

1. **Music Genres**: Exploring how different music genres correlate with depression levels. This involves examining the distribution of depression levels among individuals with varying genre preferences.

2. **Language of Music**: Investigating whether the language of music influences mental health outcomes. This includes analysing the relationship between listening to music in different languages and reported depression levels.

3. **Moderation by Depression Level**: Examining how the effects of music on mental health are moderated by an individual's depression level. This involves assessing whether certain music genres or languages have a more significant impact on individuals with higher levels of depression.

## Results 📊

The analysis provides insights into the complex relationship between music and mental health, shedding light on how music preferences may influence depression levels. Visualisations generated using Tableau offer intuitive representations of the data, allowing for easier interpretation and understanding.

## Files Included 📂

1. **Original Dataset**: The raw dataset obtained from Kaggle.
2. **Cleaned Dataset**: The cleaned dataset ready for analysis.
3. **Python Scripts**: Scripts used for data cleaning and preparation.
